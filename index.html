          For Program Director of the Lincoln Park Community
         Shelter Sean O‚ÄôGara, his call for compassion towards t
         he homeless populations in Chicago has gone unheard.
         O‚ÄôGara finds himself on the defensive. He tries to protect
          the secret population of residents of the city that he says
          emerge onto the streets more visibly in the Summer months,
          but his efforts fall short.
        </p>
        <p>
          ‚ÄúI encourage people to have a heart,‚Äù O‚ÄôGara said about the
          complaints he has heard over increased homeless presence in the city.
           ‚ÄúPlease realize what difficult situations these people are in.
           Is it really that horrible to see them?‚Äù
        </p>
        <p>
          Some community members of Chicago have reported an increased
          presence of homeless populations in their neighborhoods this Summer.
           According to the Chicago Coalition for the Homeless, 82,212 Chicagoans suffer
            from some sort of homelessness or housing insecurity.
        </p>
        <p>
          First District Sergeant of Community Relations
          Anthony Dombrowski said controlling the homeless
           population in the Loop has been a priority of the
           Chicago Police Department (CPD). After hearing several complaints
            from community members from Wards 42 and 43, the department has
            begun developing a plan to minimize crime and respect the rights
            of those living on the streets. The plan, he said, would include
            giving homeless people resources to social services in the city
            and attempting to place them into shelters and temporary housing.

          <‚ÄúCommunity concerns about illegal activity in Grant Park are being addressed¬†with a focus on making people aware of the fact that the use of our City Parks¬†is open to all,‚Äù Dombrowski said in a statement. ‚ÄúWe are also reinforcing the idea that¬†some basic rules do apply‚Äù

          According to the U.S. Conference of Mayors 2016 Hunger and Homelessness Survey, in 2015 Chicago reported 1,701 emergency shelter beds were available in city shelters. The number of beds available shrunk 17.6 percent from 2014 to 2015.
          Other factors such as disabilities, mental illness and gender limit shelter options for homeless populations, as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          ‚ÄúIn Los Angeles, homeless people sleeping in the sidewalks is a lot more pronounced than it is in Chicago,‚Äù O‚ÄôGara said. ‚ÄúHomeless people are more inclined to head to warmer climates, certainly urban areas too because you are more likely to be able to find food in an urban area than in a rural one.‚Äù Though homeless populations gravitate toward urban cities around the country, O‚ÄôGara finds policy in Chicago perpetuates a culture against homeless people.
        </p>
        <p>
          ‚ÄúA lot of people just don‚Äôt want to face reality,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere are a lot of people out there suffering and are homeless and there‚Äôs just not enough resources out there for those that need it. There are some people that are forced to live like that for different periods of their lives.‚Äù

          O‚ÄôGara urged residents to think of long term solutions like affordable, low cost housing for homeless populations.
        </p>
        <p>
          ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your solution for getting them housed? Not just out of your neighborhood,‚Äù he said.
